## Hedge Fund Activism

*authorï¼šZhengting Zhong*

This is a research project about hedge fund activism, which is conducted by Zhengting Zhong (Marlowe Chung) and advised by [Wei Jiang](http://www.weijiang-finance.com/), a professor from Columbia University.

Most of the work is based on the paper of Brav, Jiang and Partnoy Thomas (2008), *"Hedge Fund Activism, Corporate Finance and Firm Performance"*(https://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/~brav/RESEARCH/papers_files/BravJiangPartnoyThomas2008.pdf). Through updating and expanding the sample window, this project is aimed at exploring some new phenomena about the hedge fund activism.

Thank Professor Jiang again for providing the dataset and patient instructions!
